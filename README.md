        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been discussed and experimented with for decades, but recent advances in computer hardware have accelerated its growth. Unlike traditional computers that rely on central processing units (CPUs), AI systems use powerful video cards to process large amounts of data. Through machine learning and algorithms, AI can recognize patterns and make decisions without constant reprogramming. While AI can solve complex problems, the idea of it gaining human-like consciousness remains science fiction—for now.</strong> Start by introducing the topic with a clear explanation and an overview of its importance or relevance.
        </p>

      <section id="industries">
        <h2>Industries</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>AI has already transformed many industries, with healthcare being one of the most notable. It can analyze medical scans and detect potential health issues faster than human doctors. AI also helps personalize medicine by tailoring treatments to individuals. In social media, AI curates content and monitors posts, while businesses use AI chatbots to handle customer service inquiries. As AI advances, it will continue improving efficiency in fields like finance, logistics, and education.</strong> Provide the first key fact or detail about the topic, supported by relevant information or examples.
        </p>

      <section id="generative-ai">
        <h2>Generative AI</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>One of the most accessible forms of AI today is generative AI, which can create text, images, music, and code. Writers, marketers, and professionals use it for reports, advertisements, and resumes. Programmers also benefit from AI’s ability to suggest, generate, and debug code, speeding up development. AI’s combination of creativity and logic challenges the idea that these skills are separate.</strong>

      <section id="art-entertainment">
        <h2>Art & Entertainment</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>AI has also revolutionized art and entertainment. It can generate digital artwork, realistic images, and even compose music. The gaming industry uses AI to design immersive worlds much faster than human developers. However, AI-generated content raises ethical concerns, especially regarding its impact on human artists. While AI can imitate creativity, true originality remains a human trait.</strong>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="interaction">
        <h2>Interaction</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>As AI becomes more common, users must learn how to interact with it effectively. Refining queries and giving clear instructions can improve AI-generated responses. Creative users can experiment with small adjustments to fine-tune results. While AI offers exciting possibilities, it’s important to recognize both its strengths and limitations. As technology evolves, AI will continue shaping the future while challenging our understanding of intelligence.</strong>
